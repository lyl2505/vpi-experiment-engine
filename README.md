# VPI experiment engine

This experiment engine contains visual experiments created by Quinn, Greg, and Lori to collect data. The data will not be distributed to any third-party and any participant will remain anonymous. 

Jinja template engine was used to format in the HMTL. The project is hosted on a Flask server.  

## How to run

1. Clone the repository and enter in python3 `main.py`
2. Follow the link after "Running on". Example: `* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ ... `

There, you can run the experiments locally on the machine

Currently, the website is no longer hosted online.
